Real Places Theme provides Open Street Maps as an alternative to Google Maps.

Open Street Maps are activated out of the box in Theme so you don't have to setup anything or change any option.

If you have setup Google Maps API Key in your theme then simply remove the API Key for Google Maps to activate Open Street Maps.
