#### 📌 Understanding the Difference: Author vs Agent

From the visitor's perspective, both look the same.

From the admin's perspective:

- **Author**: A registered site user (with at least Author role) who adds a property from the dashboard or front-end submission page.
- **Agent**: A separate post type that can be created by users with sufficient privileges and assigned to properties.

> This flexible setup allows you to display whichever makes more sense for your use case.

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **None** | Hides the agent/author box |
| **Author Information** | Displays details of the user who added the property (editable via profile page) |
| **Agent's Information** | Displays the selected agent’s profile |

You can also change the author from the **Author meta box** on the property edit screen.
