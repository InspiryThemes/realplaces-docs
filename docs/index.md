### üõ†Ô∏è Important Note

We strongly recommend using the **child theme** to ensure smooth updates of the parent theme without losing custom changes.  
A pre-built, ready-to-use child theme is included in the main theme package downloaded from ThemeForest. The package is commonly named **`rp-main-pack.zip`**.

## ‚ö° Performance Improvement Tips

### üîπ Basic Recommendations

- Use **PHP version 7.2 or higher** for better performance and compatibility.  
  (You can contact your hosting provider to upgrade your PHP version.)  
  > _Note: PHP 7.2+ is also a [base requirement for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/)._

- Ensure your hosting server uses **SSD storage** for faster read/write speeds.

- Prefer **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** hosting over shared hosting for better performance, stability, and control.

- Install a reliable **caching plugin** and test your website thoroughly after configuration for best results.
