### Important Note

It is highly recommended to use the child theme so that you can easily update parent theme whenever a new update is available. A pre-built ready to use child theme is included in the main theme pack which you have downloaded from ThemeForest. It is commonly called **rh-main-package.zip**.

Please note some features (which you find in Classic Design) might not be available yet for Modern Design of Real PlacesTheme. We are working on adding every possible feature in Modern Design but some of them are simply not possible to add due to design limitations.

## Few Performance Improvement Tips

### Basic Recommendations

* Use **PHP 7.2 or greater** as it is faster than previous versions of PHP and a [base requirement of WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/). ( You can communicate with your hosting provider to get it updated. )
* Make sure your hosting is based on SSD drives.
* It is recommended that you should use a VPS instead of shared hosting as it gives you better resources to work on.
* Use a good cache plugin and test your site properly after installing and configuring it.
