In case of <strong>Demo Contents Import</strong> gallery pages are already created and you do not need to follow this section.

Go to <strong>Dashboard</strong> &rarr; <strong>Pages</strong> &rarr; <strong>Add New</strong> and provide a page title that suit your purpose.

Select the appropriate template from page attributes. As examples are displayed in 3 screen shots below.

<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4"><img class="light-border" src="assets/realplaces/pages/10.png" alt=""/></div>
<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4"><img class="light-border" src="assets/realplaces/pages/11.png" alt=""/></div>
<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4"><img class="light-border" src="assets/realplaces/pages/12.png" alt=""/></div>


If you want to change the default banner then you can do that from <strong>Banner Settings</strong> meta box displayed in screen shot below.

<img class="light-border" src="assets/realplaces/pages/6.png" alt=""/>

You can <strong>Publish</strong> the page once it is ready.

After publishing you need to add the newly created page in menu from <strong>Dashboard</strong> &rarr; <strong>Appearance</strong> &rarr; <strong>Menus</strong>
